Write a Python program to calculate the length of a string (from [w3resource](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/string/)).

Write a Python script that takes input from the user and displays that input back in upper and lower cases  (from [w3resource](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/string/)).

Make a program that takes a string and outputs that string with the first letter of each word capitalized.

Given an input string, write a program that identifies the index of the first instance of a character within that string.

Given an input string, find the three most common characters within that string and the number of times they are contained.

Write a program to split a given string on hyphens and display each substring (from [PYnative](https://pynative.com/python-string-exercise/)).
