# Math operations

These exercises do not need to be completed in order, but they are generally ordered in increasing difficulty. The solutions provided _are not the only possible_ solution. Your's might look different, and that is okay!

1. Write a Python program that accepts an integer (n) and computes the value of n+nn+nnn (from [w3resource](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/python-basic-exercises.php)).

2. Write a Python program to get the volume of a sphere with radius 6 (from [w3resource](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/python-basic-exercises.php)).
