# The `print` function

These exercises do not need to be completed in order, but they are generally ordered in increasing difficulty. The solutions provided _are not the only possible_ solution. Your's might look different, and that is okay!

1. Using the `print()` function, print at least four lines of your favorite poem or song lyrics. Do this on multiple lines.

2. Given three strings stored as variables, print the strings separated by a space. Then print the strings separated by commas.

3. Using the `time` module's `sleep()` function, print the string `'Waiting five seconds ...'`, then wait five seconds and print `'done waiting.`' on the same line of output.
