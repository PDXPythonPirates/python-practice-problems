# Python practice problems
Practice problems and other resources to level up your Python skills!

## The problems
Problem sets are arranged by topic and are linked below. Each problem set lists the problems and provides 1) a [repl](https://replit.com/) that you can fork to practice on your own, and 2) a solution [repl](https://replit.com/) so you can see and run some code that solves the problem. All solutions are written in Python 3.

1. [Printing](./problem_sets/print.md)
2. [Strings and string methods](./problem_sets/strings.md)
