# Python practice problems
A collection of practice problems, exercises, and other resources to level up your Python skills!

## The problems
Problem sets are arranged by topic and are linked below. Each problem set lists the problems and provides 1) a [Colaboratory notebook](https://colab.research.google.com) where you can develop code in your browser, and 2) a solution [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com) so you can see and run some code that solves the problem. All solutions are written in Python 3. [I](https://github.com/bhlmn) am not the author of most of these problems, and have provided credit when I'm not!

**The basics**
1. [Printing](problem_sets/print)
2. [Strings](problem_sets/strings)
3. [Math operations](problem_sets/math)
4. [Collecting user input](problem_sets/user_input)
5. [Lists](problem_sets/lists)
6. [Tuples](problem_sets/tuples)
7. [Dictionaries](problem_sets/dictionaries)
8. [Sets](problem_sets/sets)
9. [Functions](problem_sets/functions)
10. [Conditional logic](problem_sets/logic)
11. [Exception handling and errors](problem_sets/exception_handling)
12. [File I/O](problem_sets/file_io)
13. [Object-oriented programming (OOP)](problem_sets/oop)

**Advanced topics**
1. Decorators
