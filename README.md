# Python practice problems
A collection of practice problems and other resources to level up your Python skills!

## The problems
Problem sets are arranged by topic and are linked below. Each problem set lists the problems and provides 1) a [repl](https://replit.com/) that you can fork to practice on your own, and 2) a solution [repl](https://replit.com/) so you can see and run some code that solves the problem. All solutions are written in Python 3. [I](https://github.com/bhlmn) am not the author of most of these problems, and have provided credit when I'm not!

1. [Printing](./problem_sets/print.md)
2. [Strings and string methods](./problem_sets/strings.md)

## Other resources
* [w3resource](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/) has a collection of *thousands* of practice problems, organized by topic.
* [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-exercises-practice-questions-and-solutions/) also has *thousands* of exercises, organized by topic.
* [PyNative](https://pynative.com/python-exercises-with-solutions/) also has hundreds of Python exercises on their site.
* [100+ Python exercises for beginners](https://github.com/zhiwehu/Python-programming-exercises/blob/98c0f26239d65d85e9548e1e82a2c52b63a260d3/100+%20Python%20challenging%20programming%20exercises%20for%20Python%203.md).
* [Practice Python](https://www.practicepython.org) has dozens of exercises for you to complete, each with a solution and a mini-lesson for needed material to complete the problem.

## Contributing

### Please contribute!

The Pyrates would love help in building out this repository! As one could see above, there exists a multidude of resources across the internet for practicing Python, but we want a spot where:

* Problems are organized by topic, and somewhat ordered by difficulty
* Exercises and solutions are version controlled
* Exercises are posted in a place where you can easily run the code (a Colab notebook)
* Anyone can access these problems
* Anyone can contribute/add problems and solutions

### Steps to contribute

As such, building out this repo is a way we can accomplish all of these goals. It will take some work, so we'd love it if you contributed. Here are the steps to doing so:

1. Look at the [open issues](https://github.com/PDXPythonPirates/python-practice-problems/issues) page for areas where we need help and pick a specific problem to tackle.
2. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account. We recommend calling it `python-practice-problems-{your-first-name}` (e.g., `python-pracitce-problems-bryan` if you are blessed with such an awesome name).
3. Clone the fork to your local machine.
4. Connect your fork to the upstream `python-practice-problems` repository.
5. Before you begin making edits, pull the latest code
6. Create a new branch and make edits. Edits will be at least one of the following, and guidelines for how to do these are given in the following section.
  * Adding exercise ideas to a problem set
  * Creating an exercise notebook (or notebooks) for problem(s) in a problem set
  * Creating a solution notebook (or notebooks) for problem(s) in a problem set
  * Updating readmes to make these problems easy to find
7. Review your changes and push them to your fork
8. Submit a pull request
9. After a review, make any necessary changes

### Edit guidelines

TBD
