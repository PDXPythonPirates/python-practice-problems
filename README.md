# Python practice problems
A collection of practice problems, exercises, and other resources to level up your Python skills!

## The problems
Problem sets are arranged by topic and are linked below. Each problem set lists the problems and provides 1) a [Colaboratory notebook](https://colab.research.google.com) where you can develop code in your browser, and 2) a solution [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com) so you can see and run some code that solves the problem. All solutions are written in Python 3. [I](https://github.com/bhlmn) am not the author of most of these problems, and have provided credit when I'm not!
