# Please contribute!

The Pyrates would love help in building out this repository! As one could see above, there exists a multidude of resources across the internet for practicing Python, but we want a spot where:

* Problems are organized by topic, and somewhat ordered by difficulty
* Exercises and solutions are version controlled
* Exercises are posted in a place where you can easily run the code (a Colab notebook)
* Anyone can access these problems
* Anyone can contribute/add problems and solutions

## Steps to contribute

As such, building out this repo is a way we can accomplish all of these goals. It will take some work, so we'd love it if you contributed. Here are the steps to doing so:

1. Look at the [open issues](https://github.com/PDXPythonPirates/python-practice-problems/issues) page for areas where we need help and pick a specific problem to tackle.
2. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account. We recommend calling it `python-practice-problems-{your-first-name}` (e.g., `python-pracitce-problems-bryan` if you are blessed with such an awesome name).
3. Clone the fork to your local machine.
4. Connect your fork to the upstream `python-practice-problems` repository.
5. Before you begin making edits, pull the latest code
6. Create a new branch and make edits. Edits will be at least one of the following, and guidelines for how to do these are given in [the following section](https://github.com/PDXPythonPirates/python-practice-problems#edit-guidelines).
    * Adding exercise ideas to a problem set
    * Creating an exercise notebook (or notebooks) for problem(s) in a problem set
    * Creating a solution notebook (or notebooks) for problem(s) in a problem set
    * Updating readmes to make these problems easy to find
7. Review your changes and push them to your fork
8. Submit a pull request
9. After a review, make any necessary changes
